# Personal Portfolio
#### last version of my personal website was static UI with a little of JavaScript. I always thought it could be easier and more professional if I could have reusability of components for future plans. That's why I decided to upgrade and build the same website with React.

## Front-End: 
#### Front End part was relatively easy as I had the UI done already, and React makes it easy to incorporate outside front end with Components. 

#### Animations: At first, I struggled with achieving the same result on React, But I went through the gsap library documentation to do it.
